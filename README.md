# phava

A utility library for PHP inspired by Guava

## Status

Phava is under development. Early development is happening on the master branch.

## Roadmap

I'm only planning to port a few parts of Guava.

- Strings class
- Preconditions class

## Contribution

If there's something from Guava that you'd like added to this project (and which makes sense in PHP), please send a pull request!
